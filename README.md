# Movie Headline Generator

A tiny program inspired by [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/astli9/chris_hemsworth_to_play_hulk_hogan_in_biopic/egwq5o1) that takes a random actor, role, genre, and director, and makes a snazzy headline out all four. [Check it out here](https://rhythms06.github.io/movie-headline-generator/main.html).

Technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery.

Credits: IMDb for supplying an easy-to-parse list of celebrities.

**TODO**
* Narrow the actor and director datasets for maximum recognizability.
* Widen the role and genre datasets for maximum weirdness.
* Fix "undefined" bug.
* Make the site look nicer.
